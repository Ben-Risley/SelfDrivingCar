This program was run on a combination of Google Colab and Anaconda. The simultor used was downloaded from here:

https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim

To run this program, you will have to run through the car sim through training mode to record data to teach the AI, and then
you will run the BehavioralCloning.py file feeding in the data accuired from the simulation to train. This will output a file
called model.h5 which should be in the folder containing the drive.py file. Run the drive.py file to connect to the car sim. 
In the car sim, you will then run the program in autonimous mode to see the results from how well you've taught the AI.
